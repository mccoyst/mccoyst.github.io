Works that work
===============
These are some projects of mine that are worth using:
 * [validate](https://github.com/mccoyst/validate) is a shockingly popular Go package for automatically validating struct fields with tags.
 * [tmx](https://github.com/mccoyst/tmx) is a Go package providing a convenient struct for the Tiled editor's TMX file format.
 * [ogg](https://github.com/mccoyst/ogg) is a Go package for encoding and decoding ogg streams.
 * [vorbis](https://github.com/mccoyst/vorbis) is a Go package (using cgo but no dynamic linking) for decoding ogg vorbis. It works as-is, but someday it will be 100% Go.

Works in progress
=================
These are some projects of mine that are incomplete, but actively developed (if *very* slowly):
 * [Bass Mystery Dungeon](bmd/) is some kind of roguelike.
 * [pngplus](https://github.com/mccoyst/pngplus) is a Go package for adding arbitrary metadata (such as game state) to PNGs.
 * [vorbis](https://github.com/mccoyst/vorbis) is a Go package (using cgo but no dynamic linking) for decoding ogg vorbis. It works as-is, but someday it will be 100% Go.

Sub-sites
=========
These are fully-functional webapps:
 * [Magpie](//magpie.mccoy.space) is a link bookmarker.
 * [Itsapad](//paste.mccoy.space) is a minimal text paster.
 * [Feedme](//feed.mccoy.space) is an RSS reader.
